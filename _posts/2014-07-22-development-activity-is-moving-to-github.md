In just under a week’s time, on Sunday 27th July 2014, I’ll be moving
MyPaint’s [old Gitorious git
repositories](https://gitorious.org/mypaint/) over to the [new GitHub
ones](https://github.com/mypaint) fully, and closing down the old
location. For a while now we’ve been maintaining the codelines in
parallel to give people some time to switch over and get used to the new
site; it’s time to formally switch over now.

If you haven’t yet changed your remotes over on existing clones, now
would be a very good time to do that!

The bug tracker is moving from
[Gna!](https://gna.org/bugs/?group=mypaint) to Github’s issues tracker
too – albeit rather slowly. This is less a matter of just pushing code
to a new place and telling people about the move; rather we have to
triage bugs as we go, and the energy and will to do that has been
somewhat lacking of late. Bug triage isn’t fun, but it needs to be done.

(Github’s tools are lovely, and we’re already benefiting from having
more eyeballs focussed on the projects.
[libmypaint](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint) has started using
Travis and Appveyor for CI, the MyPaint application’s docs will benefit
tons from being more wiki-like to edit, and the issue tracker is just
frankly better documented and nicer for pasting in screencaps and
exception dumps)
