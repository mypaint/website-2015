I’m hoping that MyPaint will be able to support Windows fully starting
with the first v1.2.0-beta release. This is made possible by the efforts
of our own Windows porters and testers, and the dedicated folks who keep
MSYS2 working so well.

* (image: The Inno Setup installer we'll be using starting with the
1.2.0-beta releases.)

Releases will start happening shortly (date TBA) on Github, and you’ll
be able to pull down installer binaries for 32 bit and 64 bit Windows as
part of this.

If you’re interested in the workings of the installer build, and would
like to test it and help it improve, it’s all documented and scripted
[in the current github
master](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/tree/master/windows). Please
be aware that SourceForge downloads are involved during the build
procedure until MSYS2 fix that. Our own binaries and installers will
never be knowingly distributed – by us – through SourceForge or any
similar crapware bundling site.
