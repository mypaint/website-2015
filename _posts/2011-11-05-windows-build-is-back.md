Just to tease a bit our Windows users about a good news : today 
[Tumagonx](https://github.com/tumagonx) on our IRC channel ( #mypaint , 
FreeNode ) posted a screenshot of a recent build of Mypaint running on 
a Windows operating system environment. This simply mean Mypaint 1.0 ( 
coming soon ) will also be available for this platform.  because we 
know many users waited for it, we wanted to share the good news 
immediately. Be patient until the future packaging and download 
available.

[Update: 6 November]
For our Windows beta tester : Tumagonx packaged the ‘beta’ on his 
webpage here :
<http://opensourcepack.blogspot.com/2009/08/mypaint-git-build-for-win32.html>

Name on the list: mypaint-git-061111.7z [debug GTK dll, tablet fixed]

Help and [report your bug here](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/issues) 
using this unstable version.
