Intrest around the MyPaint project seems to have increased lately, both 
from end users and contributors. I suspect this is both due to the 
software maturing and getting more publicity (especially thanks to 
[David Revoy](http://davidrevoy.com) of the 
[Durian project](http://durian.blender.org/)). We hope to see this 
trend continue!

In and before version 0.7 practially all development was done by 
project lead Martin Renold alone. However, for the upcoming release I 
suspect that over half of the commits/code changes comes from others. 
And this is not due to Martin slacking off! Especially Ilya Portnov has 
done a lot of good work, but we also have significant contributions 
from 4-5 others. Needless to say, this is awesome.

## MyPaint v0.8?

Here are some of the larger features/improvements that will be in the 
next release.

*   Internationalization – you can now have MyPaint in your own language!
*   Layer dialog – a graphical interface for manipulating layers
*   Palette – with nifty features like autogeneration of colors/shades

*   Improved brush dialog – with tagging/grouping to make it easier to 
navigate
*   Revamped color selectors
*   MyPaint in german

We are aiming to get this out in November/December, but…

##We want your help

Besides coders we want translators and people to write documentation. 
Don’t worry if you don’t have a lot of experience, we will help you get 
started. We also want packagers so we can get into official package 
repositories. And someone to help get a Mac OSX version up and running 
(should not take much) would be great.

Interested? See the [Resources](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/wiki)
 on wiki site for how to get in touch.
