Hello everyone. I’m really happy to announce the first proper
pre-release of MyPaint 1.2.0 for those brave early-bird testers out
there.

You can download it from
<https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/releases/tag/v1.2.0-beta.0>.

Windows and Ubuntu binaries are available, all signed, and the
traditional signed canonical source tarball is there too for good
measure. Sorry about the size of the Windows installers – we need to
package all of GTK/GDK and Python on that platform too.

(Don’t forget: if you find the translations lacking for your languages,
you can help fix mistakes before the next beta over at
<https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/mypaint/>)
