It’s time to start putting the next release together, folks!

I would like to announce a freeze of all translated strings on **Sat
11th July 2015**, and then begin working on the first beta release
properly.  New features raised as a Github Pull Request by the end of
Sat 4th July stand a chance of getting in, but midnight on that day is
the deadline for new code submissions if they touch text the user will
see on screen.

The next release will be numbered 1.2.0; we are currently in the alpha
phase of development for it, but that phase will end shortly.

Fixing the remaining [alpha-cycle
bugs](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/milestones/MyPaint%201.2.0-alpha)
is going well. We currently only have four bugs left in the cycle
milestone, and that number will diminish further shortly. The main goal
right now is to merge and test any pending small features that people
want to get into 1.2.0, and to thoroughly spellcheck and review the
English-language source strings so that things will be better for our
translators.

Expect announcements about the translation effort, and dates for beta
releases shortly.
