We have just released
[libmypaint v1.4.0](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint/releases/tag/v1.4.0).
Libmypaint is MyPaint's brushstroke rendering code,
in a form that can be used by other programs.
You can download signed source for the library from the project's
[github releases page](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint/releases),

This release is mostly a maintenance and bug fix release, but there are
several new inputs and settings mostly related to offsetting dabs.
