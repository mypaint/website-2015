MyPaint badly needs *your* language skills to make the 1.2.0 release a
reality. Please help us out by translating the program into your
language. We literally cannot make v1.2.0 a good release of MyPaint
without your help, so to help you out we’ve made it as easy as we can
for you to get involved by translating program texts.

The texts in the MyPaint application are in heavy need of updating for
the 23 languages currently supported. If you’re fluent in a language
other than English, and have a good working knowledge of MyPaint and the
English language, then you can help our translation effort.

We’re using a really cool online translation service called
[WebLate](https://weblate.org/),
another Open Source project whose developers have very graciously
offered us free hosting.
It integrates with our Github development workflow very nicely indeed,
so well in fact that I’m hoping to use it for continuous translation
after 1.2.0 has been released.

To get involved, click on the [begin translating
now](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/mypaint/) link above, and sign in
with Github, Google, or Facebook. You can create an account limited to
just the Weblate developers’ hosted service too. There are two parts to
MyPaint: the main application, and its brush-painting library. Both
components need translating.

Maintaining language files can be a lot of work, so you should get
credit for the work you do. The usual workflow isn’t anonymous: your
email address and sign-in name will be recorded in the commit log on
Github, and you can put your names in the about box by translating the
marker string “translator-credits” when it comes up! If you’d prefer to
work anonymously, you don’t have to sign in: you can just make
suggestions via WebLate for other translators to review and integrate.

Even if your language is complete, you can help by sharing the link
above among your colleagues and friends on social media.

Thank you to all of our current translators, and in advance to new
translators, for all the wonderful work you’re doing. I put a lot of my
time into MyPaint trying to make sure that it’s beautiful, responsive,
and stable. I deeply appreciate all the work that others do on the
project too and, from a monoglot like myself, some of the most inspiring
work I see happening on the project by others is all the effort put into
making MyPaint comprehensible and international. Many, many thank yous.
