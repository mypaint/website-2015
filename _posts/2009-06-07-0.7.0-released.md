This is not such a big restructuring release as 0.6.0 was, but it 
contains many incremental improvements and bugfixes.

This release adds a color history, support for eliptical dabs, new 
brushes and background patterns.  Other new functions (eg.  merging 
layers) have been added.  There were many bugfixes and usability tweaks.
