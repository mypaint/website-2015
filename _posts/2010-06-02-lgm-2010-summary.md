Here is a short summary of MyPaint related things form 
[Libre Graphics Meeting 2010](http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2010).

The two most active MyPaint developers Martin Renold and 
[Jon Nordby](http://www.jonnor.com/) attended, along with a number of
MyPaint community members like "Popolon" and "Vlada". Also attending was 
serveral users, including some that use MyPaint professionally like 
[Camille Bissue "Yagraph"](http://www.yagraph.org/). Sadly 
[David Revoy](http://davidrevoy.com), professional MyPaint user and 
concept artist on the [Durian Open Movie project](http://durian.blender.org/) 
was not able to make it this year.

Martin Renold, the main developer and original creator of MyPaint did a 
technical talk on combining C/C++ with Python titled 
[Extending Python for Speed](http://river-valley.tv/extending-python-for-speed/)
(click link to watch).

An [OpenRaster](http://create.freedesktop.org/wiki/OpenRaster) 
birds-of-a-feather session was held. It drew a lot of people, both from 
free and open source projects like [GIMP](http://gimp.org), 
[Krita](http://krita.org), [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org), 
[Scribus](http://www.scribus.net/), 
[ghostscript](http://www.ghostscript.com/), and 
[Nathive](http://www.nathive.org/), but also prfessional standards people
from Adobe, Opera, and w3c attended, in addition to interested end-users. 
The topics were wide and mostly focused on long-term things, but consensus
was reached on a number of points regarding the standard and on the 
direction of the format. This work will hopfully lead to a better 
experience for users of MyPaint and the OpenRaster file format.

Next year we hope to see even more people involved in MyPaint, both 
developers, community members and artists!
