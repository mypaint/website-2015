MyPaint is well on its way to feature and string freeze,
but its brush library is stable enough to be translated now.

You can help!
The developers of [WebLate](https://weblate.org/),
a really nice online translation tool, have offered us hosting for
translations.

If you’re fluent in a language other than English, or know a
FOSS-friendly person who is, you can help with the translation effort.
Please share the link above as widely as you can, or dive in yourself
and start translating brush setting texts. It’s a surprisingly simple
workflow: you translate program texts one at a time resolving any
discrepancies and correcting problems the system has discovered. Each
text has a link back to the source code too, if you want to see where it
was set up. At the end of translating into your language you get a nice
fully green progress bar, a glowing sense of satisfaction, and your
email address in the commit log ☺

If you want to help out and have good language skills, we’d really
appreciate your assistance. Helping to translate a project is a great
way of learning about how it works internally, and it’s one of the
easiest and most effective ways of getting involved in the Free/Open
Source culture and putting great software into people’s hands,
worldwide.
