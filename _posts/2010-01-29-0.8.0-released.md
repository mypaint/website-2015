Finally we got MyPaint 0.8.0 released. There were many persons involved 
coding, creating new brushes and translating. Thanks to everyone who 
has contributed!

My personal highlight are all the new brushes, nicely grouped and ready 
to be discovered. This happened even though the number of changes in 
the brush engine was near zero. Some brushes are even doing effects 
that I did not expect to be possible.

More on the GUI side, appart from brush grouping there now is a layer 
list and a new color selector. You can also select brushes by pointing 
at a previous stroke (press w), and there is a way to draw straight 
lines (hold shift). The user interface has been translated into 14 
languages.

It is also noteworthy that the performance when zoomed out was 
improved, and of course there were many minor changes and bugfixes.

Personally I am excited about all the new contributions flowing in. But 
I hope I will also find time to work on the brush engine again. The GUI 
did require so much attention lately. Anyway, have fun with the new 
release!
