Partly due to some issues with libmypaint that need to be sorted out,
and partly due to some unfortunate heavy snowfall, the release of
MyPaint v2.0.0 is postponed for 1-2 weeks.

Although unfortunate, this _does_ mean that our ardent translators have
some more time to get those final changes in, and maybe also add themselves
to the list of translators for their language. To do this, just edit the
translation of the string `translator-credits`. This string should contain
a list of names and year(s), optionally with an email address, like the following:

```
Justin Alias
Thomas Gobsmocker, 2016-2017
Marianne Outahere, <mario@localhosting.com>
Kim Perchhummer, 2018, <kp@centralhosting.com>
John Knowitall, 2019-2020
```
