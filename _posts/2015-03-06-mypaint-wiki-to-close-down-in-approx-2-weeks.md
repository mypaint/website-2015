The [MyPaint wiki](http://wiki.mypaint.info/) will be closed down
shortly: our hosting provider will be closing down the server it runs
on.

That’s not necessarily a bad thing: it encourages us to migrate the
content somewhere a little more central, and make hard-nosed decisions
about what to keep and what to ignore that we’ve been putting off since
forever (there has been so. much. spam.!)

So, we’ll be migrating *at least* the user manual and the brushpacks
page to [our home on Github](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint) so that
they can still be maintained. If you think that anything else should be
retained, please go to

> <http://wiki.mypaint.info/>

and have a dig around. If you see an area which should be copied, please
link to it on our tracking issue for this migration,

> <https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/issues/242>

Thank you.

Especial thanks to Techmight for hosting our site and our DNS for many
years! And thanks to all previous contributors to the wiki too. We will
try to retain your content, or give you all fair warning to move it
elsewhere.
