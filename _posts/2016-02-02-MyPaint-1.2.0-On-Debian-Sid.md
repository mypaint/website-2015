MyPaint has been accepted into [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), ready for arty Debianistas to test. This is great news for people using Ubuntu, Mint, or other Debian-derived distributions too, because those distros pick packages from Debian during their release cycles.

Progress: [http://packages.debian.org/mypaint](http://packages.debian.org/mypaint)

Looks like a keen Debian developer has picked it up for integration. That's very welcome news for me at least, since I now don't need to find somebody with upload rights and convince them to upload my packages. Better still, pieces of the the debianization I've been maintaining for the Ubuntu PPA got incorporated into downstream, just as I was hoping.
