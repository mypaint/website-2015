We have just released
[libmypaint v1.3.0](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint/releases/tag/v1.3.0).
Libmypaint is MyPaint's brushstroke rendering code,
in a form that can be used by other programs.
You can download signed source for the library from the project's
[github releases page](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint/releases),
and a limited number of binary packages maintained by us
will be available shortly from other places.
See the release notes for details of other binaries,
and please badger your distribution's maintainers to get libmypaint
included for their next release.

A big thank you to all our contributers, translators, porters,
testers, and coders for your work in preparing this release.

The master branch will soon be integrating lots of new brushy features
for 1.4.x, and will be breaking all sorts of things as a result.
Watch this space ☺
