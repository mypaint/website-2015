Hi, I’m [David Revoy ( Deevad )](http://www.davidrevoy.com/) and I’m new in the maintener team of Mypaint’s website .
I start a project to add more screenshots to the “Screenshots” page of this website.
So, If you are an artist or a user and want to do a small contribution to Mypaint , I started a little campaign. You can join and find more infos and guidelines on my webpage :

All system , theme , type of art, skill and artworks are accepted. For any question, use the comment system on my blog , you can even ask anonymously.
Thanks in advance
