![question](/assets/posts/2015-12-05-state-of-website.jpg)
As many of you may have read from 
[@mypaintapp](https://twitter.com/MyPaintApp) 
on twitter, our previous host provider for both the mypaint website and 
the forums went dark a few weeks ago. No one could get into the servers 
to at least backup what we lost. Instead we decided to host mypaint on 
github pages and use Jekyll to generate our site. We have been working 
at recovering a lot missing data. The majority of data was recovered 
thanks to [Andrew Chadwick](https://github.com/achadwick) work with 
searching in Google cache files. [David Revoy] also had a backup of 
the previous website's theme. That good cause we could utilized the 
image assets it has and incorporate them in the new one. We almost have 
everything we need, but we still have a good ways to go before the site 
is ready.

The one thing we do need pretty soon is artwork for the new site. If 
any mypaint user would like their artwork made in mypaint on dedicated 
our art gallery page, please go our our 
[this issue thread](mypaint/mypaint.github.io#8) 
in our github issue tracker. I will post what we would need in order to 
use you artwork on that thread as well momentarily after this is posted. 
Just keep in mind, it will probably need to be in a creative commons 
licenses to be compatible with our site.

As stated above we also lost our forums as well. With no chance of 
recovering the site, we had to rebuild that one as well. Luckily, we 
were able to get a sponsor whom will upfront the cost to run a 
Discourse server on Digital Ocean. His name 
[Noah Chelliah](https://twitter.com/Kernellinux) who is a business 
owner of [Alitspeed](http://altispeed.com). They're an Linux IT 
Solutions company which specialize from home automation to network 
deployments. Noah is also the co-host of Jupiter Broadcasting's Linux 
Action Show, so you may have heard of him. I met him personally during 
[LinuxFest Northwest 2015](https://linuxfestnorthwest.org) last April 
and he is an interesting guy to talk to. He is passionate about all 
things Linux and he will do anything in his power to get you to switch. 
So we thank you Noah for your part in helping support the MyPaint 
Community.

There are still a lot of things that need done like gather information, 
page creation, and designing the site in due time. Our goal is to at 
least have the website ready and relaunched by the end of the year. 
With Discourse We should be ready sometime next week so stay tuned for 
that. If you would like to help us with the website, or our Discourse 
site, head over to its [issue tracker](mypaint/mypaint.github.ioissues) 
on Github. We appreciate all help even if it just mock-ups, suggestions 
or simple grammar corrections. We also need help with getting the final 
push to translating both libmypaint and MyPaint iself. For more 
information, please visit 
[this post](http://mypaint.org/blog/2015/11/21/final-translation-push-for-1-2-0/) 
on our site.

From all of us at the MyPaint Community, Thank you.
