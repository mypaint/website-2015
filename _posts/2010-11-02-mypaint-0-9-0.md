The new major release of MyPaint, version 0.9.0 is here! It has been 9
months since the last major release now, so it was about time. Hopefully
the next cycle will be a bit shorter.

Here are some of the highlights in MyPaint 0.9.0.

### New features

Users can import and export brushes. This feature was developed mainly
by [Ilya Portnov](http://iportnov.ru/). Ilya also added tilt support to
the brush engine.

One can now shows/hide all sub-windows with a key shortcut and there is
a key for showing the menu at the cursor. This work was done by [Andrew
Chadwick](http://twitter.com/achadwick). Andrew also tweaked window
behavior and fixed a number of issues in input handling and in the color
sampler.

New preferences have been added; you can now set the default zoom
level/resolution, and the default save format. The color history popup
bound to the secondary stylus button can also be disabled.

We now save thumbnails for OpenRaster files according to the
freedesktop.org specification thanks to [Till
Hartmann](http://tedil.deviantart.com/).

### User Interface

Open dialog now shows a preview supported files, also by Till Hartmann.

Saving and editing of brushes has moved together with the brush settings
dialog, which has been renamed to “Brush Editor” to reflect it’s
intended use. The brush selector has instead got the most commonly used
brush settings in an expander, for quick access during painting.
The save dialog and exception dialog have gotten small updates to
improve usability.

There are no new translations but 10 languages have been updated.

### Performance

Performance has been greatly improved in two areas: startup and file
saving. File-saving optimization was done by Martin Renold, and should
make MyPaint the fastest OpenRaster implementation out there! The
changes in how we save PNGs also make us require much less memory when
saving, which makes out-of-memory conditions less likely.

### Brushes

The default set of brushes has been changed slightly. There are now a
maximum of 35 brushes in each group so that it is easier to view the
entire group. There are now three artists brush sets; “Deevad” by
[David Revoy](http://www.davidrevoy.com/)
(of
[Sintel](http://www.sintel.org/)
fame), “Ramón” by
[Ramón Miranda](http://ramonmirandavisualart.blogspot.com/)
and “Tanda” by
[Marcelo Cerviño](http://blog.lodetanda.com.ar/)
and two non-artist brush groups; “classic” and “experimental”.
The last two groups has gotten new icons by David. In addition, pixel
and tilt brushes have been added. The wiki has
[more Brush Packages](http://wiki.mypaint.info/Brush_Packages) for
download.

There was also many other contributions, minor improvements and bugfixes
that did not make it into this post. Thanks to everyone who has
contributed to this release. Enjoy!
